* A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X and wants
* to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.
* Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.
*
* X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
* X â‰¤ Y.
